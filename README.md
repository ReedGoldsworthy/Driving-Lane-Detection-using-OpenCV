# ASCII Photo Converter

A python program that converts an image into ascii characters and prints to terminal

## Dependencies

This project uses two external python libraries: opencv-python and numpy.
These can be downloaded by entering pip install opencv-python in the terminal if pip is installed

## Usage

Run the program from the command line, as follows:

<pre>python mosaic.py &lt;image_name&gt; &lt;width&gt;
</pre>

- The `image_name` argument should contain the path to the image for which you want to build the mosaic
- The `width` argument should contain the width you want your image to be in the terminal

For example:

<pre>python main.py planet.jpg 120
</pre>
